    "# Surrogate models\n",
    "\n",
    "A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. A lot of problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate de the quality of the proposed solution.  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as optimization, become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as surrogate models, that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. "

    "## Dataset: Traffic Light Scheduling Problem\n",

    "Our surrogate model will replace the utilization of SUMO to calculate the quality of the traffic light plan. In this case, a traffic light plan consists of 190 phases (from around 45 main intersections in MÃ¡laga). We have generated around 29000 different plans and get their fitness using SUMO. These samples are the dataset used to train and test our surrogate model.\n",

In the Campus Virtual you can find the dataset file. You have to download this file and upload it in the appropriate directory in your google drive."
